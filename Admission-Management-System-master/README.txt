Before joining CSC, following my Uncle’s suggestion who currently works in a Government agency, I have worked on a project named “Admission Management System” single-handedly, finished it off and deployed it to the concerned party.


Project : Admission Management System (July 2010)

Client : ZPP High School, Balayapalli, Nellore (DT.), AP. 

Responsibilities : I was involved in taking the project through all the SDLC processes mainly creating the design, Technical Specification, Coding and Testing. 

Technology : JSP, HTML, JavaScript, AJAX. 

Server : Apache Tomcat

Database : MySQL

Project Description : The project entitled “Admission Management System” is a fully automated system that deals with the most important feature of Government Schools, admissions and Storing Fees Details. The entire process is very lengthy and requires a lot of paper work and resources.This module facilitates the admission department by managing all the required data at the finger tips. This includes effective storage and retrieval of applicants details and fees details. 

The project has only one module i.e., Admin module. The admission of the applicant is done by filling a single form. And giving the print out of the form to the parents. Further which they will take to “Head Master” for signature. 

Features of Admission Management :-

• Dynamic application form in which admission number can be generated based on the joinings.

• Effective storage of applicant and fees details, easy retrieval and updation.

• Makes things easy and fast. Suppose if the student forgets his photo. We can take picture from webcam and that can be attached to application form. Thus this will not postpone things.

• Easy Photo Upload and Updation.
